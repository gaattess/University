Second assignment that asks us to:
	You are asked to select one of the event logs and write a program in Python which:
	1. You will read the event log assigned to you
	2. It will display the structure of the trace (the keys it consists of) and the structure of the event log
	3. It will display the number of traces
	4. It will display the number of events
	5. It will display the different events that make up the event log
	6. It will display the activities with which the traces begin and end and their frequency of occurrence
	7. It will display in a table the case id, activity name, transition (start or complete), timestamp
	8. It will filter the event log and keep only traces that end with the activity "end"
	9. It will discover process patterns with alpha miner, heuristics miner, inductive miner algorithms for the original event log and for the filtered event log
	10. It will do the evaluation for each of the above event log (original and filtered) with the corresponding models discovered by each algorithm. Comment on the results in terms of fitness, precision, generalization and simplicity. Summarize them in a table for better visual effect.
	11. It will do conformance checking either with the alignments method or with the Replay fitness method. How many traces of the event log are not fit (not consistent with the process model)?
