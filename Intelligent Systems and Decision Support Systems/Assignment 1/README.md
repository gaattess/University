# Assignment implementing an ontology using the Protégé tool.

The purpose of this assignment is to design and implement an ontology, using the Protégé tool in version 5.6. The ontology we chose to implement is a cafeteria. We first describe the hierarchy of the cafeteria, with each entity representing a class. Then we analyze the properties and constraints of the classes and finally, we display the snapshots from Protégé and the information collection.

## Operation of a Cafeteria
The cafeteria that was implemented consists of people, i.e. the workforce and customers, and of objects, menu, tables and payment methods. We illustrate the hierarchy using Visio as follows:

The description of its operation is as follows.
1.	A customer enters the store
2.	A waiter seats him at one of the available tables
3.	The customer, after looking at the menu, gives the waiter his order.
4.	The waiter forwards the order to the cashier.
5.	The cashier forwards the order to the barista.
6.	When the customer's order is ready, the waiter is called.
7.	The waiter receives the drinks/snacks and takes them to the customer.
8.	When the customer has consumed the items in their order, the waiter is called to make payment.
9.	Customer pays using card or cash.
10.	The waiter transfers the POS or cash to the cashier.
